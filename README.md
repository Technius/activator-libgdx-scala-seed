# libGDX Scala Seed
This is a Typesafe Activator seed that generates a barebones [libGDX](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) project. The generated project uses Scala.

This is currently a work-in-progress.

# Usage
Generate the project files by using `activator eclipse`.

Run the application on your computer using `activator desktop/run`.

# TODO
* Implement Android project generation
* Add some way to include assets
* Address LWJGL issues after desktop/run
