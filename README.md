# libGDX Scala Seed
This is a Typesafe Activator seed that generates a barebones [libGDX](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) project. The generated project uses Scala.

This is currently a work-in-progress.

# Usage
Generate Eclipse project files using `activator eclipse`.

Run the application on your computer using `activator desktop/run`.

Create a zip file for the desktop build using `activator desktop/universal:packageBin`.

# TODO
* Implement Android project generation
* Improve asset handling
* Fix the line ending problems
* Address LWJGL issues after desktop/run
