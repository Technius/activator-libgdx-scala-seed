== Assets ==
Files contained in this folder will be packaged into the `bin` directory of the
package generated by the `universal:packageBin` task (the other tasks have not been tested yet).

To change the folder to extract to, modify the `mappings in Universal` key's last line of code:

```
a map (t => (t._1, t._2.replaceFirst("assets", "extract/here")))
```

If you modify the location of the extracted folder, make sure to change the paths used in LibGdx's asset/file handling system.
